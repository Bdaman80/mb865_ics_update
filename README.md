mb865_ics_update
================

Stock MB865 (AT&amp;T Atrix2) ICS update and root firmware / scripts

folder edison_ics is the stock AT&T Atrix2 update via fastboot

folder ICS_root is the root exploit for that update.

I am making a script to place both to phone via automated fastboot and adb commands
